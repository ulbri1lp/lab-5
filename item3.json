        "Anna Molen (b. 1954, Pulaski County, Kentucky) has been a rural letter carrier for 32 years and plans to retire next year. She remembers admiring the job of a rural letter carrier when she was growing up in Pulaski County, Kentucky. Molen was hired by the Postal Service as a rural carrier in 1990 and had known the postmaster, her boss, since she was a child. She is currently on her fourth rural route. Her first had nearly 700 boxes and was 98 miles. Her current route, which she has been delivering for 13 years, has 600 boxes and is 76 miles. Molen has her own organizational system for delivering the mail -- organizing her route sequence in several storage tubs. She is the NRLCA president in her district and has been a union member for 26 years. She has also been a trainer of new rural letter carriers for 10-12 years. In this interview, she speaks about how her background in social work related to the job of rural letter carrying, her relationships with her customers, and the new evaluated system to determine rural letter carriers' pay."
